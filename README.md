A notebook series introducing the theory and implementation of generative models, from classical latent variable models to modern deep architectures. Each notebook contains mathematical derivations and from-scratch implementations.

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure

### 1. Latent Variable Models
- [1.1 Mixture Models](./1.%20Latent%20Variable%20Models/1.1%20Mixture%20Models.ipynb/) - model data as a mixture of distributions, introducing discrete latent variables to capture clusters.
- [1.2 Factor Analysis](./1.%20Latent%20Variable%20Models/1.2%20Factor%20Analysis.ipynb) - explain data as linear combinations of continuous latent factors, uncovering hidden structure behind observed correlations.
- [1.3 Variational Autoencoders](./1.%20Latent%20Variable%20Models/1.3%20Variational%20Autoencoders.ipynb) - extend to non-linear mappings with neural networks, using continuous latent variables and variational inference.
